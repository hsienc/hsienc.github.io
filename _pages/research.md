### "Elasticity of Related-party Trade" 

Junior Honors Proposal. [<a href="/files/RpElasticity_draft.pdf" target="_blank">Draft</a>] [<a href="/files/RpElasticity_slide.pdf" target="_blank">Slide</a>] [<a href="/files/RpElasticity_slide_short.pdf" target="_blank">Slide-short</a>]

**Abstract.** I explore how the import demand of multinationals (MNEs) responds to a short-term tariff shock given the heterogeneity in shares of related-party imports. In particular, I focus on estimating the trade elasticities of MNEs during the 2017-18 Trump tariff period. Building on Amiti et al. (<a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.33.4.187" target="_blank">2019</a>) and Fajgelbaum et al. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjz036" target="_blank">2020</a>), I estimated the elasticities of related-party imports to be between -1.578 and -1.955 and more elastic than their arms-length counterparts. The preliminary finding of MNE importers/industry being more responsive to tariff changes than non-MNE counterparts under complete tariff pass-through may reflect their profit shifting process in a very short run.
