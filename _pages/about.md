I am a senior majoring in Economics and Mathematics at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. While I am still exploring different possibilities, my current research interests focus on international trade, macroeconomics, and financial economics. 

I will begin my doctoral study in Fall 2025. Here is my current <a href="/files/EricHsienchenChu_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> (Dec 2024).
