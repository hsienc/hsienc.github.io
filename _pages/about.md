I am a senior at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, majoring in Economics and Mathematics. While I am still exploring different possibilities, my current research interests center on international trade, macroeconomics, and financial economics. 

I will be starting my PhD in Finance at Wisconsin School of Business (WSB) in Fall 2025. Current <a href="/files/EricHsienchenChu_CV_PhD.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> (Apr 2025).
