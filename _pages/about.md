I am a senior majoring in Economics and Mathematics at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. While I am still exploring different possibilities, my current research interests are International Econ (Trade and Finance) and Industrial Organization. Outside of school, I ride with the Brazen Dropouts cycling team and enjoy watching Pro cycling races.

I am applying to PhD programs in Economics for Fall 25 matriculation. Here is my current <a href="/files/EricHsienchenChu_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> (Oct 2024).
